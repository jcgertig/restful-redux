Example project using Github API to show profile details
--------------------------------------------------------
The code that is `redux-model-util` specific is isolated to the [./profile-page](./profile-page) directory to make things easy.  Everything here is simply boilerplate to create a webpack build and set up a redux web application.

See [./profile-page](./profile-page) for code example
